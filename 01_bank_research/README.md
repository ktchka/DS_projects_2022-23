| Data Preprocessing     | To determine whether a client's marital status and number of children affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank â€” statistics on clients' solvency. | The absence of children in the family positively affects the timely repayment of the loan; There is no direct correlation between the level of income and the repayment of the loan - the most solvent category is "D" - with an income of 30 to 50 thousand rubles; Clients who are or have been married in the past - categories "married", "divorced", and "widow/widower" - are more solvent; In the categories of "wedding conduct" and "real estate operations", the share of clients with debt is smaller. | Data processing, duplicates, gaps, categorization, decomposition | Pandas, Python         |
