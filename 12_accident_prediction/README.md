| Capstone Project | The task is to understand whether it is possible to predict the risk of traffic accidents on a chosen route based on historical data. The risk is defined as the probability of an accident involving any damage to the vehicle. | Developing a driver risk assessment system is likely feasible. However, it's important to consider not only external factors such as road surface conditions or street lighting but also some data related to the driver themselves, like driving experience, previous involvement in accidents as the perpetrator, etc. Future considerations should include traffic density. To enhance safety, equipping vehicles with an emergency braking system is recommended. | Databases, Feature Synthesis | Pandas, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, sklearn, LightGBM, matplotlib, seaborn  |
