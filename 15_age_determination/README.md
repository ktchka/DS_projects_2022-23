| Computer Vision     | The task is to build a model based on a set of photos of people with their ages labeled, which will estimate a person's age from their photo. | Using the ResNet50 network, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 5.7 was achieved, within the specified limit of up to 8. This means the model makes an average error of 5.7 years in age estimation. | image processing, neural networks | Keras, Python              |
