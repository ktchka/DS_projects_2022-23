| Capstone Project | The aim of this study is to explore the Russian film distribution market and identify current trends. Additionally, we will separately examine films that have received state support and try to answer the question of how interesting these films are to viewers. | The results of the research on films that received government support show that the Cinema Fund has the largest share of returnable funds and the best indicators of profitability. Perhaps the Ministry of Culture should also increase the proportion of returnable support - this will stimulate the production of higher quality content. | Data Analysis        | Pandas, Python, matplotlib   |
