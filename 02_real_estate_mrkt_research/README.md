| Exploratory Data Analysis    | To establish typical parameters for apartments, which will help in building an automated system to track anomalies and fraudulent activities. | By constructing histograms for parameters such as total_area, last_price, rooms, ceiling_height for the general database and for the city center, it can be seen that depending on the location, the prevailing values change: in the center, there are more apartments with an area of 50 to 100 m2, in the general database - from 25 to 50 m2; in the center, apartments are more often priced from 5 to 10 million, in the general database - from 2.5 to 5 million; in the center, the majority of listings are 2-3 room apartments, with a small proportion of 1-room, as well as 4-8 room apartments, while in the general database, there are mostly listings for 1-2-3 room apartments, with hardly any above 4 rooms; in the center, the ceilings are higher - predominantly 2.7-3 meters, in the general database - 2.5-2.7 meters. | data processing, histogram, boxplot, scattermatrix, categorization, scatterplot, fraud monitoring | Pandas, Python, seaborn   |
