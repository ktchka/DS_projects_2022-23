| Graduation Project. Industry | The task is to build a model that will predict the alloy temperature, and the client wants to use the developed model to simulate the technological process. According to the client's requirement, the MAE of the selected model should not exceed 6.8. | The best result on the test sample was shown by the CatBoost model with an MAE of 5.21. The model's R2 value on the test sample is 0.633, which is quite far from unity and suggests that the model may not perform well with an unknown dataset. | regression, neural networks | SQL, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, Python      |
