| Capstone Project | Develop a system that predicts booking cancellations. If the model indicates that a booking will be canceled, the client is asked to make a deposit - the money will be charged from the client's account if they do cancel. Identify the best model for the task. | The Decision Tree model shows the best result as it has the highest accuracy value for the chosen threshold, and accuracy represents the proportion of true positive responses, i.e., those bookings that will indeed be canceled. Profit after implementing deposits has more than doubled, fully covering the development costs of the model. | Classification, business model | Pandas, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn |
